# About this
&emsp;&emsp;It is a wonderful library of axi4, but it is not full axi4, It is designed by systemverilog. I compact axi4 and add something to it. 
# Other
&emsp;&emsp;It contain a simple interface that only define three signals, `valid`, `ready`, and `data`. I think it is useful for design.
